## Operators and Loops

### What is an expression in JavaScript?

- an expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely evaluate.

### Why would we use a loop in our code?

- used to execute a block of code repeatedly.

### When does a for loop stop executing?

- A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.

### How many times will a while loop execute?

- A while loop continues to execute its code block as long as the given condition evaluates to True. So technically infinitely.
