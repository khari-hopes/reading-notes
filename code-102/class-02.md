*  code completion, syntax highlighting, a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue); and the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.
## What do the following commands do?
* pwd
  * It tells you what your current or present working directory is
* ls 
  * It's short for list, list current location of folder
* cd
  * stands for change directory. move around in system
* mkdir
  * used to make a new directory.
* touch
  * create, change and modify timestamps of a file.
## Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)
* cd projects
  * typically changes your current directory to a directory named "projects" if it exists within your current working directory
* mkdir new-project
  * creates a new directory named "new-project" within your current working directory
* touch new-project/newfile.md.
  * it creates a new file named "newfile.md" within the "new-project" directory, update the timestamp of a file or, if the file does not exist, create a new file with the specified name.
* cd ..
  * 
* ls projects/new-project
