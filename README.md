## Growth Mindset
A growth mindset is developing new skills or achieving goals through how much time and effort you put into it. With a growth mindset, individuals are more likely to embrace new experiences, take on challenges, and continuously strive for improvement.

### Steps Towards Growth Mindset

* PUT FORTH EFFORT
  * You can get told everything you need to know to succeed but if you don't apply any of the information you'll be right where you started.
* ASK QUESTIONS
  * If stuck ask as many questions as needed in order to process the information. No question is a dumb question.
* TAKE CRITICISM 
  * Grow from all criticism. Whether you think what was said is good or bad it was said for you to know and better yourself.
