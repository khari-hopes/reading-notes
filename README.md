## Growth Mindset
A growth mindset is developing new skills or achieving goals through how much time and effort you put into it. With a growth mindset, individuals are more likely to embrace new experiences, take on challenges, and continuously strive for improvement.

### Steps Towards Growth Mindset

* __PUT FORTH EFFORT__
  * _You can be told everything you need to know to succeed but if you don't apply any of the information you'll be right where you started._
* __ASK QUESTIONS__
  * _If stuck ask as many questions as needed in order to process the information. No question is a dumb question._
* __TAKE CRITICISM__ 
  * _Grow from all criticism. Whether you think what was said is good or bad it was said for you to know and better yourself._
