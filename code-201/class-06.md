## JavaScript Object Basics
### How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?
- An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality.
### What are some advantages to creating object literals?
- it is easier to work with than an array, when you want to identify individual items by name.
### How do objects differ from arrays?
- Objects are like labeled bins where you can put different things and easily find them using their labels. Arrays are like a row of numbered pockets where you can store things in order.
### Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.
- if an object property name is held in a variable, then you can't use dot notation to access the value, but you can access the value using bracket notation.
### Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?
- This is referring to the object, in the example the object would be dog. This enables you to use the same method definition for every object you create. Not just one.

## Introduction to The DOM
### What is the DOM?
- The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.
### Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.
- A web page is a document that can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. In both cases, it is the same document but the Document Object Model (DOM) representation allows it to be manipulated. As an object-oriented representation of the web page, it can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.
