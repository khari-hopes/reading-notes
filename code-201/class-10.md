## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.

### Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
- Syntax error is spelling errors while logic errors are only seen when running the program.
### List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
- I have used single quotes instead of double quotes which always shows a syntax error in Visual Studio. All of the errors should show up in the console.
### How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
- It helps you distinct the two different types of errors. Both errors are fixed in different ways so you know how to fix.
## The JavaScript Debugger.
### How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
-  JavaScript Debugger is a tool that lets you investigate and fix issues in your code. It works by pausing your program at specific points, allowing you to inspect the state and step through your code. It's an essential skill for software development and can make your coding life much easier and more effective.
### Define what a breakpoint is.
- point in the source code where the execution of a program temporarily pauses or stops to allow the developer to inspect the program's state, variables, and control flow for debugging purposes.
### What is the call stack?
- Call Stack shows you what code was executed to get to the current line.
