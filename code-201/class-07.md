- Helps to create a clear and structured representation of the real-world problem or system that the software aims to address.

## HTML Table Basics
### Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
- Reduce accessibility for visually impared users. Code becomes harder to write, maintain and debug.

### List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.
- <th> header section of the table.
- <tr> element defines a row of cells in a table.
- <td> defines a cell of a table that contains data.

## Introducing Constructors
### What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
- A constructor is a special type of function in programming that is used to create and initialize objects of a specific class or type.
### How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?
-  The key difference is that in an object literal, this refers to the object literal itself, while in a constructor, this refers to the instance being constructed.


## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor
### Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
- instead of creating different values we could just use main value and put prototype ath the end of the name for instance if you have a function mnQuestion you would use mnQuestion.prototype. 

NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question

## Things I want to know more about
- I don't know if I am just tired or overworking myself at the moment but I want to revisit this entire section. Having a hard time fully understanding concepts read.
